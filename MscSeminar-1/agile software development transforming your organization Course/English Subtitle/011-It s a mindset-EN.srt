1
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.000
- As you set out to transform

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.030
your organization to agile,

3
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.030
the most important first step

4
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.040
is understanding what it means to be agile

5
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.030
versus simply doing agile.

6
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.000
Executing agile, the actual process

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
of delivering work though an agile framework,

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.070
is fairly simple.

9
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.060
In many cases, companies roll out

10
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.010
the agile techniques and collaboration tools,

11
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.000
and see some improvements.

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.050
But they end up unsure

13
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.090
why they're not benefiting

14
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.060
as much as other organizations.

15
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.040
The root cause for this difference is simple;

16
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.040
it's the agile mindset.

17
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.000
Instilling this into your organization

18
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.030
requires a lot of time and effort.

19
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.050
Essentially, you're changing

20
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.020
the culture of your organization.

21
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.040
These cultural changes will help you

22
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.050
reap the rewards you've been hoping for.

23
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.020
So, what is this mindset you need to shift to?

24
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.070
Look at the agile mindset

25
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.010
as a set of foundational values

26
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.010
on which you'll build the organization.

27
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.090
Everyone in your organization

28
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.030
can use them to guide behaviors and habits.

29
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.050
Scrum has a defined set of values

30
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.050
that are a great starting point for every team

31
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.000
and for your organization, as well.

32
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The Scrum values are, first, focus.

33
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.060
Everyone focuses on the work to be done

34
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.010
and the organizational goals.

35
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.060
Next is respect.

36
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.040
Everyone treats all others with respect

37
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.060
and a belief that each person is capable

38
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.020
and are doing the best they can at all times.

39
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.060
Openness.

40
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.050
Team members, leaders, stakeholders.

41
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.040
Everyone agrees to be honest about the work

42
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.060
and the challenges they face.

43
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.000
This is also known as transparency.

44
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.030
Then comes courage.

45
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.060
This value demands that everyone do the right thing

46
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.080
and not shy away from challenges.

47
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.080
This also means that failure

48
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.040
is expected to happen sometimes

49
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.050
and will be faced as a gateway

50
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.060
to greater knowledge.

51
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.060
It also means that everyone

52
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.000
must share their concerns,

53
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
so the best solution can be found.

54
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.020
Finally is commitment.

55
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.030
Each person must fully and personally commit

56
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.080
to achieving the goals of the team

57
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.020
and the organization.

58
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.010
When you base your transformation

59
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.090
on a set of values,

60
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.000
you establish expectations

61
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.090
for the future state.

62
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.080
Everyone in the organization,

63
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.040
from the highest to lowest level,

64
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.080
now has a framework from which to make decisions.

65
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.000
Your leadership team needs to model these values

66
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.050
and provide guidance to team members,

67
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.080
so they can live these values, too.

68
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.070
These values then become

69
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.000
foundational expectations

70
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
for behaviors that will result

71
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.020
in a high-performing organization.

72
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.030
Once the mindset is in place,

73
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.030
then doing the agile practices

74
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.000
will push your organization forward faster.
