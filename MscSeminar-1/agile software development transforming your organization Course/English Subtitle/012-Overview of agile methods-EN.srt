1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.080
- Agile is a broad term

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.040
that applies to a family of practice frameworks

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.020
that are all based on the Agile Manifesto.

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.020
As you can see here, the Agile Manifesto

5
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.090
says it's focused on individuals and interactions.

6
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.060
It really wants to see working software,

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.060
and it totally wants the customer included all the time.

8
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.080
This enables us to respond to change.

9
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.040
These are the important tenets of the manifesto.

10
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.090
There are several Agile methodologies,

11
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.080
and we're going to examine the three most popular

12
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.040
and widely-used practices.

13
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.080
Not all practices will be a good fit

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.010
for each situation.

15
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.070
So let's take a look at where these might work best.

16
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.000
First, let's talk about Scrum.

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.030
Scrum is by far the most common Agile method used.

18
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.030
It's simple, and has been proven

19
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.050
to increase productivity.

20
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.010
In Scrum, the business representative

21
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.060
is part of the team and plays the role

22
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.080
of the product owner, or PO for short.

23
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.010
The PO develops the product backlog

24
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.020
that consists of new features, bug fixes,

25
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.000
and non-functional requirements

26
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
like response times.

27
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.060
The PO prioritizes all of the work

28
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.020
the cross-functional team of developers,

29
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.040
analysts, and testers work

30
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.080
to complete the backlog through a series

31
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.050
of two to four week sprints.

32
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.040
Scrum is most commonly used

33
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.040
for software development projects

34
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.010
where ongoing changes are common.

35
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.010
Scrum is a good fit

36
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.070
for distributed teams,

37
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.020
and requires close business collaboration.

38
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.050
This method is designed to handle volatility

39
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.000
in requirements, and high risk efforts.

40
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.030
Next is extreme programming, XP for short.

41
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.080
XP is an increasingly common methodology.

42
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.020
It's a very disciplined, agile approach,

43
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.000
and is focused on delivering software quickly

44
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.070
and continuously.

45
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.000
Where in Scrum, sprints are two to four weeks,

46
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.010
in XP, the cadence is one to three weeks

47
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.020
for the delivery cycle.

48
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.040
XP also demands high customer involvement.

49
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.070
XP focuses on continuous integration of code,

50
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.080
and ongoing testing.

51
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.070
Since the pace is so fast in XP,

52
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.070
it's not ideal for distributed teams.

53
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.030
It also requires a very high,

54
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.050
full-time level of involvement

55
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.090
from your business partners.

56
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.050
Finally, Kanban is a process-oriented Agile practice

57
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.080
that's based on Toyota's Just in Time production model.

58
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.020
The focus here is on eliminating bottlenecks in the system.

59
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.010
Kanban is focused on visualizing your workflow

60
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.080
as you do it today,

61
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.000
then limiting the amount of work in process,

62
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.070
and finally, on enhancing the flow of work

63
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.080
through the system.

64
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.080
Kanban is most often used in process-heavy environments,

65
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.000
especially in the areas of IT support,

66
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
where tickets or work requests

67
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.010
flow to a team on a daily,

68
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.060
or even hourly basis.

69
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.080
Generally, the work is flowed through a team

70
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.020
on a first-in first-out basis,

71
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.090
except where priority roles have been established.

72
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.010
As you set out to apply Agile methods

73
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.070
to your organization,

74
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.080
it pays to understand the available frameworks,

75
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.000
and align them to your needs.
