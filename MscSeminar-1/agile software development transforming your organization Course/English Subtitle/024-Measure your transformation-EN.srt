1
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.000
- When you launched the organization on the path

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of IT transformation, you had some goals to accomplish.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.040
These goals are a great place to start

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.010
when deciding what to measure.

5
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.060
In my experience, the most common goals

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.030
for agile implementations are faster delivery,

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.060
or speed, and higher quality.

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.000
Let's start by looking at faster delivery.

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
When measuring speed, the easiest way to measure

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.060
is simply capturing the number of deliveries each month.

11
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.040
This is an external measure that helps you understand

12
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.020
how your transformation

13
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.010
is directly impacting your external customers.

14
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.010
An additional metric to start tracking

15
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.030
is lead time for the work being done.

16
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.010
Tracking lead time, or the duration

17
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.000
between the request and the delivery,

18
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.050
is an internal speed metric.

19
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.080
This can provide valuable insight

20
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.000
into the efficiencies being created in the organization

21
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.090
as you implement agility.

22
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.010
In terms of quality, the most direct measure

23
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.050
is defect tracking.

24
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.080
I recommend teams track their own defects,

25
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.030
and these can then be combined across teams

26
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.030
to provide a broader view.

27
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.000
When tracking defects, I find it useful

28
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.010
to know how many defects the team found during development.

29
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.070
Most importantly, it's best to track

30
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.070
the number of defects found after the release

31
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.040
or found by customers.

32
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.040
These defect trends can provide visibility

33
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.030
on how your transformation is improving

34
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.070
the end product customers experience.

35
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.090
Another area to track during your transformation

36
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.050
is the cultural aspect.

37
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.060
Agile can't take hold unless your culture is changing too.

38
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.030
Agile relies heavily on collaboration

39
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.000
and team empowerment.

40
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.070
A simple pulse survey to your IT staff

41
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.000
can provide transparency on both fronts.

42
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.020
For example, you can ask simple questions like:

43
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.050
On a scale from one to 10

44
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.070
where one is low and 10 is high,

45
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.050
how healthy is collaboration within your team?

46
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.040
This question can tell you

47
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.020
how well the transformation is working

48
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.060
at the team level.

49
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.030
On a scale from one to 10

50
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.040
where one is low and 10 is high,

51
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.010
how healthy is collaboration across teams?

52
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.030
This question provides visibility

53
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.050
into the health of the system

54
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.070
or the team of teams.

55
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.030
On a scale from one to 10

56
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.090
where one is low and 10 is high,

57
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.040
how autonomous is your team?

58
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.000
This question really provides information

59
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.030
on where the transformation stands

60
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.030
in terms of empowering teams.

61
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.050
This is the foundation for high performance.

62
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.020
In all cases, make sure you baseline measurements

63
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.080
before your transformation begins.

64
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.040
It's much easier to tell the story

65
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.060
of your agile success when you know where you started.

66
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.000
When you choose the right metrics,

67
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.040
you'll be able to keep your transformation on track

68
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.000
and share the good news.
