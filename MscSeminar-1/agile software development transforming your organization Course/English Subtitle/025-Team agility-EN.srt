1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.040
- As you establish your agile teams,

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.000
you'll want to start measuring

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.050
their growth in agile practices.

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.070
This can help you understand where there are areas

5
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.080
you should provide additional training

6
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.030
or support to the teams.

7
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.060
Almost all teams track their velocity metric.

8
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.020
For our purpose of understanding how agile

9
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.080
or healthy a team is, this metric is not useful.

10
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.020
While it's a great tool for the team to use

11
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.040
and self assess, since point measures vary by team,

12
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.020
they aren't useful when you're looking

13
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.040
across the department.

14
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.040
There are a few metrics I recommend using.

15
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.010
First, measure team size.

16
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.030
Any team with fewer than three people

17
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.080
or more than 10 people is going to be less efficient

18
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.030
than teams sized between four and 10.

19
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.000
When a team falls outside these parameters,

20
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.070
it's time to look into the situation and try to remedy it.

21
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.010
This is an ongoing measure and should be looked at monthly.

22
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.060
Also related to this is a measurement

23
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.000
of team member dedication.

24
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.040
While complete dedication to a single team

25
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.070
is the ideal state, it may not be possible for every team.

26
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.080
Measure this and try to ensure that fewer than 30%

27
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.070
of team members are working on more than one team.

28
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.060
Next, capture the ratio of committed

29
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.070
to completed story points for each sprint.

30
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.060
This measure gauges the team's ability to plan effectively.

31
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.020
The goal is for the team to hit their commitment

32
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.090
within 10%, plus or minus.

33
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.070
For example, if a team committed 20 points

34
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.040
and completed 18, they're within their goal.

35
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.060
This you'll want to measure every four sprints or so.

36
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.090
The expectation is that the team usually hits their metric.

37
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.030
If the trend shows continuous large misses,

38
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.020
you'll want to investigate further

39
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.000
and help the team with additional coaching or training.

40
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.090
Next, release frequency is a good metric of team agility.

41
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.050
This will tell you whether working software

42
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.060
is being released to production after each sprint.

43
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.010
If it isn't happening, it will tell you

44
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.040
how long releases are actually taking.

45
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.060
Again, this metric will indicate whether the team

46
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.090
has the environment they need to release.

47
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.060
Additionally, it can provide insight

48
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.080
into what the product owners are deciding

49
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.020
as being valuable to release.

50
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.090
Both are good areas for investigation and collaboration.

51
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.040
Finally, technical excellence is a great metric to track.

52
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.050
This is captured by understanding how many defects

53
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.060
are found by the team during development,

54
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.020
by others outside the team, and by customers.

55
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.070
When you start to measure team agility,

56
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.060
you'll start to see patterns across the organization.

57
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.050
For example, if all teams have high numbers of defects

58
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.080
that are found by customers, it's an opportunity

59
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.020
for you to take action and help the teams improve

60
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.030
with education or tools.

61
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.000
You don't need to measure all of these things,

62
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.020
but be sure to select at least a few items.

63
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.010
What you do measure should be related to the goals

64
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.070
you set for your transformation.

65
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.000
When you measure your team's agility,

66
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.020
you'll gain valuable insight

67
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.000
into the health of your transformation.
