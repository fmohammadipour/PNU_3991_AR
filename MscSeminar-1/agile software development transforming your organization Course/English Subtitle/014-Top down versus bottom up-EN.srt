1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.020
- You may have heard the ongoing debate

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.050
about how to approach an agile transformation.

3
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.030
The debate usually centers around

4
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:09.080
either a top-down approach

5
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.090
or a bottom-up approach.

6
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.020
There is, of course, a third option,

7
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.010
and that's the 360-degree approach.

8
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.060
Let's put the debate to rest

9
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.030
and explore each of these options.

10
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.090
Let's start with the bottom-up approach,

11
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.030
because this happens quite often.

12
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.010
A bottom-up transformation

13
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.060
means exactly what you might infer,

14
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.040
the people at the lowest level of the organization

15
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.030
start the transformation at the team level.

16
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.060
The belief is that team level success alone

17
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.060
will earn buy-in from management.

18
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.070
While this is great,

19
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.070
since it means that you have some innovators

20
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.030
willing to make changes to get better results,

21
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.030
it's also risky to the organization.

22
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.050
For example, if several teams

23
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.000
are running Scrum independently,

24
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.090
there's no overarching goal

25
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.040
or roadmap to the transformation.

26
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.020
It can yield spotty results

27
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.040
without a cohesive vision or plan.

28
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.010
The benefits to be gained will also be limited

29
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.060
when this transformation

30
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.080
bumps into immovable objects,

31
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.080
like release schedules and project phase-gates.

32
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.020
Next, let's talk about the top-down approach.

33
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.090
This approach has the leaders

34
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.080
mandating an agile transformation.

35
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.010
While you need executive buy-in,

36
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.020
forcing teams to do anything

37
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.000
rarely gets you what you're looking for.

38
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.030
Most of the time,

39
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.050
the executives declare the mandate

40
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.030
but are too far removed

41
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.050
from the trenches where the work is done

42
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.090
to see the situation clearly.

43
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.000
In this case, executive expectations

44
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.010
can severely exceed ground-level capabilities.

45
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.090
The risk here is obvious.

46
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.070
When expectations are unrealistic,

47
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.020
any success will be minimized.

48
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.050
Additionally, top-down approaches

49
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.020
tend to occur in the command

50
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.070
and control style of leadership

51
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.050
that an agile mindset is trying to get away from.

52
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.090
Finally, let's explore the 360-degree approach.

53
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.000
This approach, as you might expect,

54
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.010
suggests approaching your transformation

55
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.030
from both the top and the bottom simultaneously.

56
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.030
In my experience, organizations that use

57
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.060
this approach are far more successful

58
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.050
than those using either top-down or bottom-up alone.

59
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.090
In this approach,

60
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.000
you end up with the best of both worlds.

61
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.070
The executive leadership team

62
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.050
is knowledgeable about agile

63
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.080
and is fully supportive of the changes needed.

64
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.070
They're willing to lead the change.

65
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.020
At the same time,

66
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.050
teams by business unit or product

67
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.010
are empowered to explore

68
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.070
the agile methods available to them

69
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.090
and find the one

70
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.060
that most closely suits their needs.

71
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.090
In this way, the team members

72
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.010
can customize where needed,

73
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.030
thus making them more committed

74
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.050
to what's implemented.

75
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.050
Agile transformations can be approached

76
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.070
from more than one angle.

77
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.050
Take the time to understand

78
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.080
which approach will bring you the greatest success.

79
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.010
When you do, your transformation

80
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.000
will yield great results.
