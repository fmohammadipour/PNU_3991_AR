1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.070
- In any organization, there are dozens

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.080
of requests for projects.

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.010
Usually, all the ideas make it

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.090
into the portfolio of work

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.010
and nothing is ever rejected.

6
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.050
The challenge most organizations face

7
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.030
is assessing the ROI

8
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.090
of these requests quickly and easily.

9
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.000
You'll need to make sure both the business voice

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.070
and the technical voice are heard in this effort.

11
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.010
A technique I recommend is the PACE technique.

12
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.060
It's fast, simple and, most importantly,

13
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.020
tells you what not to do.

14
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.050
PACE stands for priority,

15
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.010
action, consider, and eliminate.

16
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.080
This technique places all of the ideas

17
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.030
along this spectrum

18
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.010
and helps you organize

19
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.000
around the most valuable work.

20
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.080
Here's how it works.

21
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.030
First, schedule a prioritization meeting

22
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.060
with your business leadership team.

23
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.040
This group will represent the business voice

24
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.000
and speak strictly to the business value

25
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.030
they see in each idea.

26
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.000
You'll also need your technical leadership team.

27
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.040
This group represents the technical voice

28
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.000
and speaks strictly

29
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.020
to the effort involved

30
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.090
in executing on each idea.

31
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.030
Next, create a numbered list

32
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.050
of your projects or customer needs.

33
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.010
Make sure this list is visible

34
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.030
to all the attendees.

35
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.020
Third, once everyone is in the room,

36
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.090
you'll need to come to an agreement

37
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.040
on what difficult and easy mean

38
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.000
in terms of effort or cost.

39
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.070
This represents the technical voice.

40
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.010
It'll be different for every organization,

41
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.060
but the definitions need to be consistent

42
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.000
for every idea presented in this and future sessions.

43
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.070
For example, you may define easy

44
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.090
to mean one team can complete

45
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.070
the work in one month, or two sprints.

46
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.010
You may decide difficult means

47
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.050
multiple teams are needed

48
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.060
for at least one quarter, or six sprints.

49
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.020
You'll also set the definitions

50
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.020
of high and low on the value scale.

51
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.020
This is the business voice.

52
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.010
For example, you may define low value

53
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.090
as benefiting less than 25% of customers

54
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.000
while high would benefit more than 80%.

55
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.060
Now, you'll create the PACE metrics

56
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.080
on a whiteboard or flip chart.

57
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.000
The X-axis represents the business voice,

58
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.070
and the scale starts with high on the left

59
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.030
and moves to low on the right.

60
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.050
The Y-axis represents the technical voice

61
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.030
and moves from difficult at the bottom

62
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.070
to easy at the top.

63
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.000
Finally, ask the business leaders

64
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.070
to write the numbers representing

65
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.070
the ideas along the X-axis.

66
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.030
The business can't move the number

67
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.010
vertically on the scale, only horizontally,

68
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.010
since they can't speak to the technical

69
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.050
difficulty of the implementation.

70
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.090
Then, ask the technical leaders

71
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.030
to move the numbers

72
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.080
the business has placed on the value line

73
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.050
vertically so that its difficulty

74
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.030
is represented on the cost effort scale.

75
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.000
Finally, add the PACE lines.

76
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.060
The top-left corner is where

77
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.060
your organization should focus.

78
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.020
These have the highest benefit

79
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.060
and will require the least amount of work.

80
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.050
Using the PACE technique,

81
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.080
you can help your business partners

82
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.030
make wise ROI decisions.

83
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.000
Your partnership with the business team

84
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
will prove the value of your transforming organization.
