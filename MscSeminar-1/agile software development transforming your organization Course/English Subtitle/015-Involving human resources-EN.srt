1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.080
- As you begin mapping out your transformation,

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.020
you've probably already realized

3
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.000
that the success of your organizational change

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.030
is completely dependent on the people in it.

5
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.070
This is true for every organizational change you make.

6
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.020
When you're planning a full transformation,

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.050
it pays to engage your human resources team or HR.

8
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.070
Let's take a look at a case study about Volvo

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.050
and their realization that HR could have helped them

10
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.070
through the transformation.

11
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.030
At Volvo, the vast majority of employees

12
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.070
are not at the management level.

13
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.060
That being the case, the existing HR frameworks

14
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.020
for communicating with employees can help.

15
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.020
This type of robust communication channel

16
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.050
can spread accurate information.

17
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.080
In the absence of up to date information

18
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.070
about the transition, employee fear and uncertainty grows.

19
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.080
Utilizing HR could have helped Volvo

20
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.090
expand their communication reach.

21
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.060
Another area where HR could have helped Volvo

22
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.080
is in the area of job role mapping.

23
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.080
Volvo shares that HR should be involved

24
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.050
in identifying new roles.

25
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.010
HR is essential in helping leadership

26
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.040
create transition plans for people

27
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.040
to grow into new responsibilities.

28
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.090
As the older structures of the organization

29
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.030
shift to the new agile reality,

30
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.000
HR's help in defining new career paths

31
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.010
can also ease the fears of employees.

32
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.090
Volvo noted that this encouraged employees

33
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.060
to feel safe and valued in the dynamic environment.

34
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.070
Additionally, establishing KPIs for staff

35
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.070
as they transition into their new responsibilities

36
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.020
will also help employees feel safe.

37
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.030
There will be changes needed regarding how team members

38
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.000
are measured and mentored.

39
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.030
Here, HR is an essential partner.

40
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.040
Since HR has a key role in reinforcing company culture

41
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.020
and training policies, it makes sense to include

42
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.090
this aspect of HR in your transformation as well.

43
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.070
Given the reach of HR,

44
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.000
Volvo found that engaging HR to survey staff

45
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.060
during the transformation could provide useful information

46
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.040
engaging the health of the transformation.

47
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.040
Finally, your HR department can help build training

48
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.040
and educational curriculum for existing employees

49
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.060
and new hires.

50
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.010
The material should span both the mindset

51
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.080
and the tactical agile methods you're implementing.

52
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.000
This level of standardized education

53
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.090
will reinforce a cohesive culture in your organization.

54
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.070
Specifically, that means the transition

55
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.090
is happening as a whole, not in silos.

56
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.090
When you take these steps in partnership with HR,

57
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.050
you'll create an agile transformation

58
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.000
that's effective and, most importantly, sustainable.
