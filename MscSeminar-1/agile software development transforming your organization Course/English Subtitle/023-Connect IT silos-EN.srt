1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.010
- Organizational silos are common.

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.040
In fact, they're everywhere.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.060
Silos generally develop to solve very specific problems.

4
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.080
When specialized knowledge or skill is needed,

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.070
you build a group of specialists to tackle the problems.

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.070
These groups then become silos of knowledge and skill.

7
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.010
When you look at a typical IT department,

8
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.060
the organizational structure is a series of silos.

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.060
For example, you usually see divisions along specialty.

10
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.030
Software development may be one of your silos.

11
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.040
Even that can be subdivided into further silos

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.070
like .NET or Java.

13
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.060
While it's good to have the breadth and depth of knowledge

14
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.070
to effectively run your organization,

15
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.060
it can cause problems.

16
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.070
The problems are probably ones you're already seeing

17
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.040
in your organization.

18
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.000
Namely, information isn't shared freely.

19
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.040
Each knowledge area has their own

20
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.000
key performance indicators, or KPIs,

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.020
and many times they conflict with each other.

22
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.080
For example, the software development silo

23
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.000
may have KPIs related to the frequency

24
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.040
of new software deployments.

25
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.050
That KPI may demand frequent release of code.

26
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.010
At the same time, the testing silo may have KPIs

27
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.090
related to the number of defects found in code

28
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.060
before it's released.

29
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.070
This push/pull in your department

30
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.070
can cause conflict between the silos.

31
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.030
That conflict distracts everyone

32
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.040
from focusing on the mission.

33
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.080
As you move through your agile journey

34
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.030
you'll need to address the silos in your organization.

35
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.040
Creating cross-functional teams

36
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.030
and getting started on DevOps will help.

37
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.090
There is still more to do, though.

38
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.060
You may have already heard the term networked organization,

39
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.000
and that's really what you'll need to do

40
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.010
so that all of IT is directed toward the common goal.

41
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.000
A networked organization is simply one that understands

42
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.050
that the knowledge silos, or clusters,

43
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.040
are necessary, and, in fact, vital.

44
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.070
Further, it focuses on connecting the clusters

45
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.070
as closely as possible.

46
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.000
This is known at the path length.

47
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.050
Your goal then is to strengthen the skills in the clusters

48
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.000
while finding ways to keep the path links

49
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.020
between the clusters short.

50
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.040
There are simple steps you can take

51
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.080
to foster networking in your organization.

52
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.020
First, I suggest implementing

53
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.090
an onboarding program within IT.

54
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.080
You'll want the program to include cross cluster members

55
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.070
in each class.

56
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.090
Further, you can have mid and senior employees

57
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.030
lead the program.

58
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.030
This will encourage mentor/mentee relationships.

59
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.060
In the end, your new employees

60
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.040
will have the informal networks needed

61
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.090
to shorten the path links.

62
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.070
As you transform your organization,

63
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.040
remember silos aren't your enemy.

64
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.080
You can leverage them

65
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.000
and start networking your organization.
