1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.090
- When you're preparing to undergo

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.040
an IT department transformation,

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.020
it's essential to understand who will be affected

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.070
by the changes you're introducing.

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.020
Identifying these key areas and leaders

6
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.080
can ultimately spell success or failure

7
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.000
for your transformation.

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.040
Strictly speaking, everyone in your organization

9
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.040
is a customer of IT.

10
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.030
However, it's helpful to spend some time

11
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.080
identifying your key customer groups

12
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.090
and strategize how your transformation will affect them.

13
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.050
A simple technique to use in identifying

14
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.040
your key stakeholders is to look at data

15
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.030
related to service and support requests.

16
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.040
The goal here is to understand

17
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.050
who the heaviest users of your IT services are.

18
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.080
What's important is knowing their department or area

19
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.080
and getting a rough count of how many requests

20
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.070
or services have been provided.

21
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.030
For example, let's say I'm the CIO

22
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.020
of a large insurance organization.

23
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.060
I've reviewed my service requests for the last two years

24
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.090
and see that most of the requests

25
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.090
come from the claims department,

26
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.030
and the fewest from finance.

27
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.070
Now that I have this data in hand,

28
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.080
I'm going to layer in what I know about my projects

29
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.020
over the last few years.

30
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.080
In this case, I'm looking to identify the departments

31
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.020
or areas that had projects with IT resources

32
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.030
and the relative size of those efforts.

33
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.030
Again, I see that the claims department

34
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.000
has kept us very busy

35
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.040
with three small projects,

36
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.020
four medium size projects,

37
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.040
and one large effort.

38
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.000
Conversely, finance has both

39
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.050
a few large projects and a few small or medium projects.

40
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.070
What this tells me is that I'm going to need

41
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.010
a different engagement strategy for finance

42
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.090
than I use for claims and customer service.

43
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.060
You might be wondering why.

44
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.030
Well, finance doesn't engage with IT very often.

45
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.090
When that's the case,

46
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.040
communications about changes I'm making to processes

47
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.010
will need to repeat over a longer period of time.

48
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.010
When there are infrequent touch points,

49
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.040
I'll have to repeat the information

50
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.070
for a longer period before the changes

51
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.070
become habit to them.

52
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.010
On the other hand, with claims and customer service,

53
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.040
they interact with IT more often,

54
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.000
so the changes will become normal for them fairly quickly.

55
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Now that I know these things,

56
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.050
I can modify my list to identify the leaders

57
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.070
of these organizations.

58
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.070
These are people that I'll go to

59
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.010
and share my plans with.

60
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.070
I'll enlist their help in defining

61
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.060
my communication strategy in their organizations.

62
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.020
In fact, given the frequent interactions,

63
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.010
I'd ask an individual in the claims area

64
00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.040
to partner with me on a pilot of my agile transformation.

65
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.020
Agile relies heavily on customer engagement.

66
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.010
Be sure to take these steps to identify

67
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.000
and bring your internal customers with you.

68
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
When you do, you'll find the partners you need to succeed.
