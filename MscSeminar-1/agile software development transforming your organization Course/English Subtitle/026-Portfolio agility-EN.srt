1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.010
- We know that an Agile transformation

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.050
will impact every area of the organization.

3
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.000
You'll be applying metrics

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.050
at the team and organization level

5
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.040
to see the health of the transformation.

6
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.070
The portfolio is the entry point

7
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.000
for work moving to the teams.

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.010
Assessing the well-being of the portfolio transformation

9
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.070
is a key element.

10
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.050
What should you be looking for?

11
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.040
Well, there are many measures you can use.

12
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.040
For me, there are four key measures that I look for.

13
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.040
First, I like to measure strategic alignment.

14
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.020
Every company has strategic objectives they try to attain.

15
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.080
These objectives are linked to the company's mission.

16
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.040
Therefore, all work being done should be directly linked

17
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.070
to attaining one of those objectives.

18
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.050
This is a straightforward tracking item.

19
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.020
Each feature or work item that's in the portfolio backlog

20
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.020
or is actively being worked

21
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.050
should tie to at least one of the objectives.

22
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.000
If something isn't linked,

23
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.050
it's an invitation to assess

24
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.050
whether the feature should be killed

25
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.040
or transformed into something with alignment.

26
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.060
Next, it's a great idea to measure investment class targets.

27
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.030
When budgets are created,

28
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.050
they're usually divided into categories of work.

29
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.080
I use the run, grow, and transform classes.

30
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.040
Run features are related

31
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.090
to keeping the business going as is.

32
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.010
Grow features are those that will expand the footprint

33
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.070
of existing products and services.

34
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.030
Transform features are related to creating

35
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.030
completely new products or services.

36
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.030
It's likely that your budgets reflect these classes.

37
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.050
Keep tabs on the work that is active

38
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.050
or planned in your portfolio

39
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.030
to ensure work is aligned to established investment classes.

40
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.030
Third, I like to keep track

41
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.000
of the overall efficiency of the system

42
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.020
by capturing a cycle time metric.

43
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.020
This measures how long it takes

44
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.030
for a feature to be completed once work starts.

45
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.000
The goal is to keep cycle time as low as possible

46
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.080
without having a negative impact on quality.

47
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.000
Finally, related to quality

48
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.060
is a measurement of business value.

49
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.060
For this, I use a Net Promoter Score, or NPS.

50
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.070
An NPS measures customer loyalty to your brand.

51
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.000
This is known as the relationship score.

52
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.020
Another type of NPS measures a customer's experience

53
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.050
with a specific transaction.

54
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.060
In this case,

55
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.050
if you've released a new feature

56
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.060
and want to gauge the customer experience with it,

57
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.070
you can use an NPS transactional survey

58
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.010
to gain insight into the value being delivered.

59
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.060
This can be used with both internal and external customers.

60
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.010
As you measure the transformation against your goals,

61
00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.080
you'll gain valuable insight

62
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.070
into where you may need to shift your focus.

63
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.030
Keeping track of your portfolio health

64
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.000
will help you ensure you're delivering what's needed.
