1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.020
- If your organization hasn't already adopted

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.080
some Agile practices,

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.050
I'm sure you've been hearing

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.060
about the benefits of moving in this direction.

5
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.090
There are several business imperatives

6
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.000
facing organizations today

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.060
and Agile methods can help you attain them.

8
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.010
The most common driver that I hear about

9
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.050
is the need to get software out the door more quickly.

10
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.000
We live in an on-demand world.

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.020
The rise of disruptive businesses

12
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.060
and the immediacy of social media

13
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.030
have raised customer expectations.

14
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.030
They demand to get what they want now.

15
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.060
The latest data from the VersionOne

16
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.030
Annual State of Agile Report

17
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.050
reveals that 75% of organizations adopting Agile do so

18
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.010
because they want to accelerate their software delivery.

19
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.040
By another name,

20
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.000
this is something your organization's time-to-market.

21
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Of course you're wondering if that actually happens.

22
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.010
Well, the same dataset reveals that 62% of companies

23
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.030
actually did see improvement in their software delivery

24
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.040
and time-to-market.

25
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.020
Another driver facing businesses today

26
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.090
is related to the one we just talked about.

27
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.050
Given the lightning quick speed of the market

28
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.000
and customer demands,

29
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
organizations also need to implement processes

30
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.050
that enable them to quickly respond

31
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.070
to changing requirements.

32
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.080
When companies shift to Agile,

33
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.050
64% of them say they're doing it

34
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.040
because they need a new way to manage changing priorities.

35
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.010
When they do move to Agile, 71% see benefit in this area.

36
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.070
What's interesting here

37
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.040
is the implied impact across their companies

38
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.080
that leads to another benefit of Agile methods.

39
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.060
In order to know what those changing priorities are,

40
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.060
you need to create better alignment

41
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.020
between IT and the business people

42
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.000
who connect you to your customers.

43
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.090
While only 49% of companies listed this as their goal

44
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.070
in their Agile adoption,

45
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.090
a full 65% saw improvement in this area.

46
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.060
Improvement in this alignment

47
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.040
can give you other benefits too.

48
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.020
When there's closer alignment,

49
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.060
all interested parties will have better visibility

50
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.050
into the progress of their projects.

51
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.070
In fact, no one surveyed listed this

52
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.090
as a driver for their adoption.

53
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.040
At the same time, 66% of companies did see this benefit.

54
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.030
Oh, and better visibility generally increases quality

55
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.060
since in short cycles Agile allows your stakeholders

56
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.000
to buy in to what's being delivered.

57
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.020
So, here's the question.

58
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.010
As an IT leader, are you being asked to deliver more

59
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.040
while exactly matching shifting requirements

60
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.070
and bringing your customers along with you while you do it?

61
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.000
If you answered yes, then Agile can help you get there.
