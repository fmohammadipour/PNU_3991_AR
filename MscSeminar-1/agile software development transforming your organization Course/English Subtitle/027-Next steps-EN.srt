1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.050
- Undertaking an agile transformation is a huge effort.

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.080
It will take all of your skill

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.040
to move the organization forward.

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.010
Remember no organization's transformation is like any other.

5
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.090
Each is as unique as your company.

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.090
Agile is intended to be tweaked, to perfectly fit your needs

7
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.060
and it's intended to evolve as

8
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.080
your organization grows and changes.

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.020
As long as you remain grounded in the agile mindset,

10
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.080
you'll be just fine.

11
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.080
Thank you for spending time with me

12
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.080
as we examine all of the changes

13
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.080
that will need to take place.

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.000
To help you continue on your transformation journey,

15
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.060
I recommend you read the following books.

16
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.010
First, 'Turn the Ship Around' by David Marquet.

17
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.040
This is an inspiring story of transformation

18
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.080
on a nuclear submarine.

19
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.040
'Value Stream Mapping' by Karen Martin and Mike Osterling,

20
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.020
which will help you identify and understand

21
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.090
your IT organization as a group of value streams.

22
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.090
Finally if you want a deeper look at DevOps,

23
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.090
I suggest you read 'Leading the Transformation'

24
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.050
by Gary Gruver and Tommy Mauser.

25
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.020
If you haven't already, it might be a good time

26
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.080
to find an agile coach you can partner with

27
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.000
to roadmap your transformation.

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.070
Thank you so much for taking this deep dive

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.020
