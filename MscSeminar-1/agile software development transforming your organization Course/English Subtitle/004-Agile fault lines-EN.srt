1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.080
- If you've already adopted some agile practices,

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.040
are you seeing the great benefits everyone is talking about?

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.080
If you're not, I promise you you're not alone.

4
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.030
Agile is not a silver bullet.

5
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.040
It won't solve all your organization's problems for you.

6
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.010
In fact, agile's main strength is exposing the problems

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.020
that have been slowing you down all along.

8
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.030
It doesn't solve them, but it shows you what to target.

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.000
So when agile fails,

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.010
it's showing you a roadmap of things to fix.

11
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.030
Once fixed, these things get out of the way

12
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.060
and you start seeing the results you've been expecting.

13
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.030
So if you're not alone in this, what are others seeing?

14
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.050
Let's look at some of the most common sources

15
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.030
for the problems organizations face.

16
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.030
One root cause for many problems

17
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.080
is simply the lack of training and experience.

18
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.090
In many cases, the introduction of agile is led

19
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.030
by only one or a few people.

20
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.030
These folks learned about it on the internet

21
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.020
and want to give it a try.

22
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.040
There's nothing wrong with that,

23
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.080
and it can be successful for a team or two.

24
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.050
As agile expands beyond that level, though,

25
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.050
you need to invest in training and coaching

26
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.050
to ensure what's being done is done well and sustainably.

27
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.080
Another root cause is your company culture.

28
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.050
Agile is not simply a set of practices.

29
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.010
It's a mindset.

30
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.060
Quite frankly, that mindset tends to run counter

31
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.060
to traditional corporate cultures and philosophies.

32
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.090
Examine your company culture.

33
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.070
Will it be hostile to the agile principles and values?

34
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.090
If it will, agile can only be successful in small pockets

35
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.030
unless you take steps to change your culture.

36
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.090
Next, consider the management team you have in place.

37
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.050
If your transformation isn't well-planned,

38
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.030
this group of leaders will discover on the internet

39
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.060
that in its purest form,

40
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.010
agile has no defined role for managers.

41
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.070
When they see that,

42
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.010
they may work hard to ensure agile doesn't replace them.

43
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.080
Now, you and I both know these leaders are essential

44
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.000
to an organization, agile or not.

45
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.050
As you build your transformation roadmap,

46
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.050
make sure this group is part of it

47
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.020
and has a clearly defined role with training.

48
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.010
Now, consider the tools you have in place

49
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.010
for coding, testing, and deploying.

50
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.030
In many cases, the teams are becoming faster,

51
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.010
but the apparatus for testing and moving code is founded

52
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.050
on waterfall phase gates.

53
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.030
If you want to move to agile at scale,

54
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.030
you'll need to tackle your tools

55
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.060
as part of your transformation roadmap.

56
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.050
Finally, let's talk about metrics.

57
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.060
Agile has a great set of metrics at the team level

58
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.090
that can be consistently applied,

59
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.030
but as you scale to programs and the whole portfolio,

60
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.080
there isn't a comprehensive set of standard metrics.

61
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.070
You'll need to implement this so that you know what to do

62
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.070
to further the transformation.

63
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.050
If any of these things sound familiar,

64
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.030
these may be some of the reasons

65
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.040
you're not seeing the agile benefits you hoped for.

66
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.000
You can make changes to reap the rewards you want.
