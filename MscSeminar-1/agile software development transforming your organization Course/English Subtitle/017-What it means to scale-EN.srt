1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.010
- As organizations transition to adopting

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.050
more agile frameworks, they run into challenges.

3
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.030
The concept of scaling agile comes from the need

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.020
to resolve these issues.

5
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.090
Scaling is simply a shorthand way of saying

6
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.030
you're expanding the footprint of agile in the organization.

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.050
Think of scaling in terms of which teams

8
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.010
or groups of teams have adopted the agile mindset

9
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.090
and practices.

10
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.000
For example, the simplest way to scale agile

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.040
is for multiple teams to adopt agile.

12
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.040
Usually, this is done within a product.

13
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.060
For example, if you're working at Amazon,

14
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.060
you may have more than one team

15
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.010
working on the private wishlist feature.

16
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.090
When all the teams working on private wishlists

17
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.070
are using agile, you've scaled agile to that product.

18
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.030
Then, you may see how well this is working

19
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.080
and decide that all teams on the list platform

20
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.050
should use agile practices too.

21
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.090
This is scaling the platform.

22
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.020
Both of these examples are focused on product delivery.

23
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.010
You can also scale or expand your agile

24
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.020
at the organizational level.

25
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.090
For example, if I were leading an IT department,

26
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.070
I could choose to use agile throughout my whole area.

27
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.050
This is organizational scaling.

28
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.090
All the teams in my area would transform

29
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.010
to the agile mindset and frameworks.

30
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.050
I could then help my peer leaders

31
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.060
to see the benefit of agile

32
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.070
and influence them to scale their departments too.

33
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.060
When those other areas start to adopt agile,

34
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.000
this is enterprise scaling.

35
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.070
It means that the agile mindset and practices

36
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.070
are used everywhere in my company.

37
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.040
It helps to understand that scaling

38
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.020
isn't a single thing.

39
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.010
It has many facets, and you can choose how

40
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.030
and where to start.

41
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.090
When you know this, you'll make the right decision

42
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.000
for your organization.
