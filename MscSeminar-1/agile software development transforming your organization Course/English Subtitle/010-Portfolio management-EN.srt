1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.040
- When you introduce Agile methods at the team level,

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.000
you'll definitely see some great benefits.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.010
It won't, however,

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.000
solve every problem you're facing as an organization.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.070
Let's take a look at the experience of Elekta

6
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.030
and what happened when they adopted Agile at the team level.

7
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.000
Elekta is a high-tech organization focused on solutions

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.090
for treating cancer and brain disorders.

9
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.080
Elekta started by applying Agile, specifically Scrum,

10
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.080
for three teams that were distributed globally.

11
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.020
Each of the teams was working on the same product.

12
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.000
Elekta saw some very real, tangible results.

13
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.040
They experienced increased delivery of work

14
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.090
through their teams and had real,

15
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.070
functioning deliverables each and every Sprint.

16
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.060
They were able to leverage additional agility

17
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.000
at the feature level.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.080
This meant that their business partners

19
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.030
could make smart choices about refining direction

20
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.030
as they learned more.

21
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.050
Elekta also learned that there were still some gaps

22
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.040
that team-level agility couldn't provide.

23
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.060
For example, they realized their teams lost the visibility

24
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.010
across the teams.

25
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.050
While they were delivering quickly and effectively

26
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.070
on their product,

27
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.080
they couldn't see what other teams were doing

28
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.040
and how it all fit together.

29
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.080
In essence, Scrum alone didn't address two key elements.

30
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.030
First, an intake process for all product initiatives

31
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.040
across the portfolio, and second,

32
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.010
a way to coordinate and organize the team's work.

33
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.090
What did Elekta do to solve that?

34
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.040
Well, they set out to better understand the demand

35
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.010
across their product lines and strategic initiatives.

36
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.040
Elekta realized that this understanding

37
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.030
was the foundation to building roadmaps

38
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.020
that can take the organization where it needed to go.

39
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.050
Once they understood the roadmap,

40
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.080
they were able to begin planning the work

41
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.070
and estimating the effort needed to accomplish it.

42
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.090
Elekta created an organization of business

43
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.060
and engineering experts to work together

44
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.080
to complete this high-level analysis and estimation.

45
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.050
The next step, of course,

46
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.030
was to compare what they knew of the estimates

47
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.070
to the capacity the teams actually had.

48
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.060
With this information,

49
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.040
Elekta was able to control the flow of work to the teams.

50
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.030
Further, Elekta was able to accurately forecast

51
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.020
what work would be done when.

52
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.050
This has created an environment where long-term planning

53
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.070
is real and effective.

54
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.050
As you forge your transformation plan,

55
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.060
be sure to include portfolio management changes

56
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.020
into your roadmap.

57
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.040
When you do,

58
00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.000
you'll see real benefits for your long-term planning goals.
