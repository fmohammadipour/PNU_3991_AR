1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.030
- We know there are several scaling models out there.

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.030
Let's take a look at the Scaled Agile Framework,

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.030
SAFe for short, and why an arm of the US Government,

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.000
Fannie Mae has chosen it.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Fannie Mae is the largest provider

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.070
of mortgage financing in the US.

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.080
After the housing crisis in 2013,

8
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.020
Fannie Mae recognized that it needed to be more responsive

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.080
to changing customer demands.

10
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.060
The SAFe model is all about alignment and collaboration

11
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.000
across large numbers of Agile teams.

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.030
It relies heavily on Agile software development,

13
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.030
Lean product management and systems thinking.

14
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.060
SAFe has Scrum or Kanban teams

15
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.050
at the foundation of the model.

16
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.070
Groups of teams working together at the program level

17
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.040
are formed into Agile Release Trains or ARTs.

18
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.070
All the teams within an ART collaborate

19
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.050
around a product increment or PI.

20
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.040
In SAFe, the PIs are on a cadence

21
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.000
or schedule that releases in unison.

22
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.010
Usually the PI is three months or a quarter in length.

23
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.020
At the portfolio level, SAFe has created a detailed model

24
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.040
around how organizations can select

25
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.030
the right work to complete.

26
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.050
It also helps sequence the order

27
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.040
of the work flowing into an ART.

28
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.010
Work is funneled to the ARTs

29
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.000
from the portfolio management team

30
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.080
that approves work based on organizational objectives.

31
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.060
Then related work items are sequenced

32
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.090
to create product increments.

33
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.090
Fannie Mae chose the SAFe model

34
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.020
because it focuses on continuous

35
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.030
integration and early testing.

36
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.090
Adopting Agile and SAFe allowed them to mitigate risk.

37
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.000
Fannie Mae has seen a couple of results.

38
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Reduced risk through their focus

39
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.040
on automation and continuous integration.

40
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.010
Dramatically improved quality

41
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.070
as evidenced by significantly reduced defect rates.

42
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.040
Let's look at the pros and cons of the SAFe model

43
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.030
to help you get started with your decision.

44
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.000
On the pro side this is the most

45
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.040
popular scaling model out there.

46
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.090
Since it's so prevalent it's easy

47
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.000
for an organization to find the training

48
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.090
and coaching they need to support their roll out.

49
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.000
SAFe even provides a detailed roadmap

50
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.010
telling you how to implement it.

51
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.000
SAFe is well suited to large organizations

52
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.060
and emphasizes establishing teams

53
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.080
that stay together for a long time.

54
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.050
On the con side of SAFe.

55
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.010
First, since you're being told

56
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.020
what to do to roll it out

57
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.000
you don't have to have deep organizational

58
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
understanding of why you're doing it.

59
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.050
If you're looking for that Agile mindset culture change,

60
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.090
SAFe might not deliver.

61
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.040
This is a highly prescriptive model,

62
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.080
you need a lot of training

63
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.040
throughout the whole organization.

64
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.090
People criticize SAFe for pushing training

65
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.060
and certification as a revenue model,

66
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.050
and because access to information can be restricted,

67
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.000
you have to be a member of the SAFe community

68
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.030
to get all the details.

69
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.030
Speaking of which, to learn the SAFe framework

70
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.070
you'll want to go to their website for additional details.

71
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.050
But don't make your decision based

72
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.070
on these characteristics alone.

73
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.090
The pros and cons of scaling models

74
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.090
only make sense when assessed

75
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.000
against your organization's needs.
