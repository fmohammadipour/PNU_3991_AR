00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.020
- Before setting out to scale,

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.000
you need to consider the pros and cons of the models.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.050
Let's look at the Spotify model and why ING Bank chose it.

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.060
This model is named after the company

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.040
that created the model, Spotify.

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.030
Based on the Scrum methodology,

7
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.070
in this model the work is done by Agile teams

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.070
known as squads.

9
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.070
At ING Bank, each squad is highly autonomous,

10
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.070
focused on a single client-related activity

11
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.020
and has no more than nine members.

12
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.080
It's also interesting to note

13
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.050
that these squads include business expertise

14
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.020
like marketing and product management along with IT members.

15
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.060
In order to handle coordination across the squads,

16
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.030
tribes of squads are formed.

17
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.080
Tribes then are what you'd find traditionally

18
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.070
at the program level.

19
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.090
Tribes coordinate priorities,

20
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.050
budgets and interact with other tribes

21
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.030
when there are dependencies.

22
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.050
In order to maintain technical consistency within a tribe,

23
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.070
chapters are formed to define and ensure best practices.

24
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.020
For example, .NET developers from squads within a tribe

25
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.080
would form a chapter to ensure all teams were coding

26
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.000
to architectural guidelines.

27
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.070
Guilds are formed for the same purpose.

28
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.090
The only difference is that guilds form

29
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.080
across multiple tribes.

30
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.070
ING Bank chose the Spotify model for several reasons.

31
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.060
Key among those reasons are it's focused

32
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.080
on minimizing barriers to agility like bureaucracy.

33
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.040
It empowers individuals and provides autonomy to teams.

34
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.050
And most importantly, centering the squads around single,

35
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.040
customer-focused objectives

36
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.080
truly made it a customer-centered organization.

37
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.090
What are the results of their choice?

38
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.060
ING Bank has dramatically improved their time-to-market

39
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.030
and has become the primary mobile bank in the Netherlands.

40
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.070
Now let's look at the pros and cons of the Spotify model

41
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.070
to help you get started with your decision.

42
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.010
One of the pros for using Spotify

43
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.050
are the cross-functional teams.

44
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.090
The squads can handle the whole development lifecycle

45
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.030
and put the product into customer hands.

46
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.000
It's designed to do all of these things quickly

47
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.060
and with high quality.

48
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.040
Given the squad-tribe-chapter-guild structure,

49
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.030
Spotify is highly focused

50
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.010
on maintaining architectural integrity

51
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.020
and high coding standards across the whole organization.

52
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.030
This is another pro for using Spotify.

53
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.030
On the con side, this model is product focused.

54
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.030
That means that if you have fixed schedule releases

55
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.080
where there are external date pressures,

56
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.050
this model may not fit well for you.

57
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.090
Further at the portfolio level,

58
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.020
there is no prescribed format for work management

59
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.070
and prioritization before it flows to the teams.

60
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.010
There is an assumption

61
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.070
that a healthy product management organization

62
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.070
is in place to handle these aspects.

63
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.040
Additionally, dependency management is handled informally

64
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.010
at the tribe level and may not provide the level of rigor

65
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.070
you're looking for.

66
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.050
No matter which model you choose,

67
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.030
make sure you're crystal clear

68
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.050
on the objectives you hope to attain.

69
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.000
With this foremost in your mind,

70
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
you'll choose the right framework for you.
