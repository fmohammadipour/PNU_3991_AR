1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.090
- While you're transforming your organization,

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.040
it's not enough to engage your internal customers.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.050
You also need to leverage your external customers

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.020
to ensure you're building the right products.

5
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.040
This is something the IT department

6
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.020
can rarely manage on their own.

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.030
This calls for additional deep partnership

8
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.020
with your product development and marketing departments.

9
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.030
Start by understanding how external customers

10
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.050
are currently being engaged.

11
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.070
While there's no standard playbook across all industries

12
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.030
for customer engagement,

13
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.060
some elements are needed universally.

14
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.010
Start by understanding your company's current strategies

15
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.000
in the areas of opportunity assessment

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.010
and solution exploration.

17
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.090
In the area of opportunity assessment,

18
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.080
it will be helpful for IT

19
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.060
to understand the process being used

20
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.010
to identify new products or product enhancements.

21
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.080
Your goal is to understand

22
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.050
how external customers are being leveraged.

23
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.000
To maintain market viability, it's critical

24
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.040
that your customers are part of this process.

25
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.040
If it's not already happening,

26
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.000
use your influence to get it started.

27
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.080
Some techniques you can suggest

28
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.040
to your product partners are things

29
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.090
like social media engagement,

30
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.020
webinars to help your customers use your products,

31
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.070
and ask for volunteers to help solve some problem

32
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.090
or design a new product.

33
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.070
With this information and a close partnership

34
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.070
with your product team, IT can help generate ideas

35
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.000
and have early visibility into future projects.

36
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.060
Once opportunities are identified,

37
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.000
you then need to ensure IT is part

38
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.030
of solution exploration as well.

39
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.080
In many cases, the results of opportunity assessment

40
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.020
become projects immediately.

41
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.040
When this happens, all the risk shifts

42
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.020
to the teams doing the work.

43
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.000
Instead, use your partnership with your product team

44
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to insert a solution exploration step into the process.

45
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
In this step, you and the product area will form a team

46
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.030
and set a short time box.

47
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.060
The goal is to experiment with prototypes

48
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.060
that will prove or disprove the feasibility

49
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.010
of the opportunity idea.

50
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.060
Make sure you have customer feedback on the prototypes.

51
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.050
This can ensure value in the market as well.

52
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.010
By taking this step,

53
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.060
you now have validated data to work with.

54
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.080
When the new idea for this new product

55
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.020
comes before the project approval team,

56
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.090
it will be a simpler decision

57
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.050
regarding whether or not this opportunity moves forward

58
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.010
and becomes a project.

59
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.040
At this point, you've effectively shared the risk

60
00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.020
between IT and product, and done so in a cost-effective

61
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.060
and time-effective manner.

62
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.010
You're investing less up front

63
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.070
in order to justify greater expenditure later.

64
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.020
As an IT leader, engaging your external customers

65
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.080
usually involves other departments in your organization.

66
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.040
Use your influence, and these steps

67
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.000
to create a customer-focused organization.
