1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.060
- As you start your transformation,

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.070
you need to take a look

3
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.070
at how your IT department is organized.

4
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.030
Most likely, you're organized

5
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.030
around technical specialties.

6
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.060
For example, you probably have a team

7
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.010
of DBAs with a manager that's a DBA expert.

8
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.070
The same is true for all

9
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.090
the other technical specialties.

10
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.060
When projects arise,

11
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.060
you've probably pulled individuals

12
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.010
from those specialty areas

13
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.030
to form cross-functional teams

14
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.080
until the project is completed.

15
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.010
When you're transitioning

16
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.060
to an agile environment,

17
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.050
all this needs to change.

18
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.050
The speed of agile relies

19
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.000
on establishing cross-functional teams

20
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.060
that stay together, or persist.

21
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.090
These persistent teams need to have

22
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.070
all the skills it takes to deliver software

23
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.030
from concept to cash.

24
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.040
When you create teams like these,

25
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.000
you'll be developing deep

26
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.030
knowledge within those teams.

27
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.080
Deep expertise like this

28
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.030
creates an environment

29
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.080
where innovation can grow.

30
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.090
One manager can handle three

31
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.060
or four cross-functional teams.

32
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.060
The challenge for the manager

33
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.090
is to recognize that they're no longer

34
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.010
the expert and problem solver for the team.

35
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.030
Their role shifts to one of support,

36
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.020
mentoring, coaching, and issue resolution.

37
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.070
They're empowering the teams

38
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.070
to solve technical problems themselves.

39
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.070
Are they still a technical resource for the team?

40
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.020
Of course they are.

41
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.010
But their role isn't to provide answers,

42
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.010
it's to ask the questions

43
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.000
in a way that pushes the team

44
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.060
to find the best solutions themselves.

45
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.090
I realize it can be overwhelming to think

46
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.070
about reorganizing the whole IT department.

47
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.070
One of the best tools you can use to help you

48
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.050
is a value stream map.

49
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.060
This is a lean management tool

50
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.010
that helps you visualize

51
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.000
the steps a product takes

52
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.080
as it goes from concept through development

53
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.070
and release to your customers' hands.

54
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.040
Don't try to value stream map your whole department;

55
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.070
just pick one product or application to start with.

56
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.020
You can then systematically

57
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.070
target other products and applications.

58
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.080
Your goal is to truly understand

59
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.030
how things currently exist.

60
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.060
You need to understand how the work passes

61
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.010
between teams and individuals.

62
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.050
It's really critical that this mapping effort

63
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.050
is done by talking to people in your department.

64
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.030
You can't rely on documentation that already exists.

65
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.020
Why?

66
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.050
Well, over time, documented procedures

67
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.050
are treated as guidelines.

68
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.010
That means that team members

69
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.070
have been modifying the guideline

70
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.030
with their actual behavior.

71
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.090
They do this not to circumvent policy or procedure,

72
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.070
but simply to make it more useful in the real world.

73
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.080
Since your goal is to understand the reality,

74
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.090
talking to people is the best way

75
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.070
to get what you need.

76
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.080
With this information, you'll begin to see

77
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.020
what skills are needed on your cross-functional teams

78
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.060
to get product out the door.

79
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.000
You can then visualize

80
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.030
what your reorganized department could look like.

81
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.080
When you're starting to transform,

82
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.070
these steps can help you

83
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.000
create a vision for the future.
