1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.060
- You can transform your organization to agile practices

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.070
without implementing any changes

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.010
to the underlying systems and processes teams use.

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.000
These underlying structures

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.060
are the things that teams use to test and deploy code

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.050
into the production environment.

7
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.070
Transforming to agile

8
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.090
without implementing any changes in this area though

9
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.080
will limit the benefits you see from your transformation.

10
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.030
You might wonder why that is.

11
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.030
So let's explore it for a minute.

12
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.080
Your teams will be doing agile development.

13
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.070
That means they'll be following Scrum, XP,

14
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.070
or any of the other frameworks.

15
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.020
Teams will unlock the advantages of speed and quality

16
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.060
that come with that change.

17
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.080
However, organizational agility is something else entirely,

18
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.030
and that's what DevOps provides.

19
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.080
DevOps is the practice of partnership

20
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.020
between software development and operations engineers

21
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.070
throughout the entire value stream.

22
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.040
From design all the way through production support

23
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.020
for the products being released,

24
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.020
the engineers work together

25
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.030
to ensure the quality and stability of the product.

26
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.040
DevOps focuses on automating the processes

27
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.060
between software development teams

28
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.020
and IT infrastructure teams.

29
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.020
The goal is to build, test, and release software

30
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.000
faster and more consistently.

31
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.030
As a whole, the DevOps movement

32
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.020
applies the agile principles and mindset

33
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.000
to the practice of releasing and supporting

34
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.050
the deployed solution.

35
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.020
DevOps seeks tighter integration

36
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.070
between software and operations.

37
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.050
It's a framework then for continuous delivery,

38
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.010
continuous integration, and automated testing.

39
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.090
I have worked with organizations that transformed to agile

40
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.040
without having a plan or a roadmap in place

41
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.080
for DevOps transformation.

42
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.000
The result of these transformations

43
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.070
was only partially successful.

44
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.040
This is because all they did

45
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.060
was to push the barriers to agility downstream.

46
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.030
What I mean by this

47
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.060
is that before those organizations adopted agile,

48
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.010
the teams were slow and couldn't produce products

49
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.030
fast enough in the traditional environment.

50
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.080
Agile methods provided

51
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.080
the fast development lifecycle they needed.

52
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.060
However, when they didn't improve the ways

53
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.040
the teams tested and released code,

54
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.090
the system remained just as slow as they were before.

55
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.080
Now the bottleneck for delivery is no longer the team.

56
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.080
It's the infrastructure supporting them.

57
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.050
As you plan out your agile transformation,

58
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.060
take the time to include DevOps changes into your plan.

59
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.010
To help you get started,

60
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.010
check out the LinkedIn learning course

61
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.030
DevOps Foundations: Lean and Agile.

62
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.080
When you do, you'll be on your way

63
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.000
to full organizational agility.
