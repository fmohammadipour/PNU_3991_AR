1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.010
- There are several approaches

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.020
you can take for your transformation.

3
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.070
However, there are critical steps

4
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.030
that must be accomplished,

5
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.060
no matter which approach you choose.

6
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.080
If you miss one or more of those steps,

7
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.080
you'll face challenges in your transformation.

8
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.050
First, you must have a vision

9
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.010
for what you're transforming and why.

10
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.000
This is your call to action

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.080
for anyone and everyone

12
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.060
involved in this endeavor.

13
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.050
It becomes your elevator pitch

14
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.080
to all of your stakeholders.

15
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.040
This is the essential first step

16
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.050
in your transformation.

17
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.030
Next, you need to create a team

18
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.070
of individuals who believe in your vision

19
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.090
and are dedicated to getting it done.

20
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.030
It's important to know that this focused

21
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.000
and dedicated team needs to be made up

22
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.060
of the most senior leaders in the organization.

23
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.020
While some tasks and activities

24
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.020
can be delegated to others,

25
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.000
the vision, direction, and momentum

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.020
needs to come from the top.

27
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.020
This is your transformation executive board.

28
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.080
Next, you and this core group

29
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.040
will need to build your transformation roadmap.

30
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.080
Some of the things you should

31
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.060
account for in your roadmap include

32
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.000
the organization context for your transformation.

33
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.090
This means you'll need to examine

34
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.010
who will be affected

35
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.040
by the transformation you're planning.

36
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.000
Are these changes restricted

37
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.050
to IT only projects?

38
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.020
Will your business partners be affected?

39
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.090
You need to know the answers to these questions.

40
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.010
Once you know the context,

41
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.070
now you need to understand your customers

42
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.030
and look for partnerships.

43
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.030
I recommend looking at your stakeholders

44
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.020
as either interested or committed.

45
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.080
Are they interested?

46
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.030
Meaning, it may affect them

47
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.040
on projects in the future.

48
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.080
If yes, they just need to be kept in the loop.

49
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.000
If they're committed, you need to ensure

50
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.020
that they're part of the planning and execution.

51
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.060
They should be on your transformation board.

52
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.040
Next, examine how your existing portfolio

53
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.010
will need to change.

54
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.020
In most cases, you've been following

55
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.060
a heavy work intake and tracking process.

56
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.010
This will need to be modified

57
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.000
to get the most out of your transformation.

58
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.080
Then, you'll need to determine

59
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.060
which agile practices you'll implement.

60
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.020
There should be organizational

61
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.030
guardrails on what's being used,

62
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.010
and a consistent framework

63
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.010
for measurement and delivery.

64
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.010
Make sure your roadmap also addresses management.

65
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.020
What is the vision for their role going forward

66
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.060
and how will you train and coach them

67
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.060
to meet those new expectations?

68
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.040
Next, you'll need to tackle

69
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.000
your overall IT organizational structure.

70
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.090
You'll need to answer questions like,

71
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.040
will the hierarchy change,

72
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.020
and will the reporting

73
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.080
and team structures be altered?

74
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.070
Make sure you're addressing technical foundations

75
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.070
throughout your transformation.

76
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.030
You need to make sure that teams

77
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.030
have the right tools to succeed

78
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.090
and space to innovate.

79
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.000
Finally, you'll need to transform your metrics

80
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.090
so you have visibility to your projects,

81
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.030
as well as the health of your transformation.

82
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.090
I know the list of targets

83
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.090
for your transformation is long,

84
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.080
but with some forethought and planning,

85
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.000
you can make it happen.
