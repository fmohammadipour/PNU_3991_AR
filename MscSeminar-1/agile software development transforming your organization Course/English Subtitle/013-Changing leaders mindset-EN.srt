1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.070
- As you embark on transforming your organization to agile,

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.030
it's essential to remember that you can't do it alone.

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.020
You know that you need to reach out to your business peers

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.040
and leaders, but even that isn't enough.

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.000
You also need to encourage and foster the transition

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
within your own leadership team.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.060
The first step in doing this

8
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.090
is to start with those leaders that report to you.

9
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.030
You'll start by sharing your vision with them

10
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.080
and gaining their support.

11
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.090
The next step with this group is to provide them training.

12
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.060
There are different types of training they'll need.

13
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.060
The first type is in the fundamentals of agile.

14
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.080
That includes both the philosophy, or mindset,

15
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.090
and the tactical details of the agile methods

16
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.070
you'll be rolling out.

17
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.050
Another type of training is often forgotten,

18
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.050
and that's role-specific training.

19
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.030
Missing at this item can be disastrous

20
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.040
for your transformation.

21
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.080
We all know that the leaders on your team

22
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.000
will still have their traditional accountabilities

23
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.090
for budget, productivity, and employee engagement.

24
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.020
However, the way in which they execute

25
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.060
on those responsibilities will be different

26
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.000
in an agile organization.

27
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.030
Agile leaders are not task managers

28
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.060
or a directive in how things are accomplished.

29
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.010
Agile leaders rely on establishing goals,

30
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.010
including deadlines, and then inspiring and empowering

31
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.080
their teams to take the lead on the execution of the work.

32
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.060
This is a huge shift for your leaders.

33
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.030
Historically, your team has been successful

34
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.040
at deciding on the path

35
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.070
and directing people to follow their need.

36
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.030
Agile demands leadership from behind,

37
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.050
where the leader is establishing a goal

38
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.070
and creating an environment

39
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.080
where the team members can succeed.

40
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.010
The next level of leadership preparation

41
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.040
is for the next layer down on your organization.

42
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.010
You've gained support for your vision

43
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.010
from your own team members.

44
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.070
Now they need to do the same with their team members.

45
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.020
These leaders will need to follow similar steps

46
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.010
with their team members.

47
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.020
They'll need the same training in the agile mindset,

48
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.030
methodologies, and role-specific guidance

49
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.020
for them to follow.

50
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.030
In my experience, the hardest change to make

51
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.040
is not the tactical implementation of an agile approach.

52
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.020
The hard part is the shifting mindset,

53
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.040
from commanding and controlling,

54
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.080
to enabling and empowering.

55
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.040
In order to create fertile ground for this mindset shift,

56
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.080
you have to start with leadership buy-in

57
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.030
all the way to the top of the organization.

58
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.080
This buy-in communicates that the change is not optional.

59
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.090
Take the time to set the stage for your agile transformation

60
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.040
by engaging and transforming your team.

61
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.090
When you do this, you're taking steps to make sure

62
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.000
agile succeeds for you.
