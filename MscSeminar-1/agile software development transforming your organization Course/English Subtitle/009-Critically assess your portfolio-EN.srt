1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.070
- Transforming your organization is more complex

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.050
than simply changing processes and practices for your teams.

3
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.030
In order for your transformation to sustain,

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.040
you have to change the way work is given to the teams.

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.090
In many organizations,

6
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.060
the portfolio of projects or simply your portfolio

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.010
is an unwieldy list of all the great business cases

8
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.040
that have accumulated over the years.

9
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.020
It represents projects of varying sizes

10
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.030
and often abstract benefit.

11
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.060
Your first step in getting a handle on the portfolio

12
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.030
is deeply examining everything that's already out there.

13
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.030
This is tactically an easy thing to do

14
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.050
but strategically it's very hard.

15
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.070
That's because for every project in your portfolio,

16
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.010
there's an approved business case

17
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.090
that has one or more people

18
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.050
that's passionate about its delivery.

19
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.080
The first step then

20
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.070
is to start working with these stakeholders.

21
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.010
Your goal is to influence them

22
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.060
and help them see that the status quo is inefficient

23
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.020
and doesn't deliver the value they want quickly enough.

24
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.090
The portfolio hasn't been as nimble

25
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.050
as the business needs it to be.

26
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.010
Once you have their buy-in

27
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.030
to help you critically assess the portfolio,

28
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.030
there are a couple of key steps you can take to get started.

29
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.020
First, gather a list of all the projects in your portfolio

30
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.050
and decide what the shelf life of a business case should be

31
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.040
for your organization.

32
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.010
Yogurt expires and so should your business cases.

33
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.020
This may sound radical but consider this,

34
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.010
the business case is based on a set of assumptions

35
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.060
that were true at that time.

36
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.080
Business and our marketplace changes daily.

37
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.010
A set of assumptions from last year

38
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.030
are not likely to be valid today.

39
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.050
In most cases, if an approved business case

40
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.000
hasn't had work started in one year from its approval date,

41
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.040
it needs to be rewritten and resubmitted.

42
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.000
The assumptions it began with may not be valid anymore.

43
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.040
Don't you want to know whether it's still valid

44
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.090
before work starts?

45
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.020
Of course you do.

46
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.070
Next, you want to ensure that every business case

47
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.090
has stated links to the overall business strategy.

48
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.050
Stakeholders should know

49
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.020
not just the value that the work will deliver to the company

50
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.030
but also that it's aligned

51
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.000
to the long-term business objectives.

52
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.060
Finally, you may have already used PACE

53
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.070
or another method to set the priority of the work

54
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.060
but now you need to compare those high-priority items

55
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.060
against each other.

56
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.020
This is known as sequencing the work.

57
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.090
It helps you understand which high-priority item

58
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.070
should be the first to be executed.

59
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.030
Most companies use the weighted shortest job first

60
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.080
or WSJF for short.

61
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.070
Essentially, WSJF measures the ratio

62
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.050
of the expected business value the work delivers

63
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.060
against the amount of time it will take to deliver it.

64
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.060
It recognizes that items with the highest cost of delay

65
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.050
should be completed first.

66
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.050
As you critically assess your portfolio,

67
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.020
you'll be establishing a flow of work from your business

68
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.040
and through the factory of your Agile teams.

69
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.090
When you do this,

70
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.000
you'll enable your organization for full business agility.
