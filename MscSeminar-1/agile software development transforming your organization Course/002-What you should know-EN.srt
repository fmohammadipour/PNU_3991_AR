00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.030
- Your situation and organization will be unique.

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.050
This course takes a very tactical approach

3
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.080
to what steps are required

4
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.050
even if their timing is different across organizations.

5
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.040
We'll deepen your understanding

6
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.040
of what it takes to transform to agile.

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.070
We'll explore both the frameworks and the needed mindset.

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.000
If you're new to agile, I recommend taking my course

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.010
on Transitioning from Waterfall to Agile Project Management.

10
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.030
Many organizations have already made some progress

11
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.050
introducing agile methods to their organizations.

12
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.070
But, you may be unsure why you haven't seen

13
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.060
the results you hoped for.

14
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.070
We'll explore why this may be happening for you.

15
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.040
From there, we'll start looking at a more holistic view

16
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.010
of an agile transformation.

17
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.080
We'll probe the allies you'll need to bring on your journey.

18
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.070
We'll also discuss measurements that can provide you

19
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.080
visibility into how your own transformation is going.

20
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.000
If you're ready for a deep tactical examination

21
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.070
of transitioning to agile, this is the course for you.
